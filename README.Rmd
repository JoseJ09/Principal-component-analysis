# Principal-component-analysis

We will study the actions of the Spanish stock market: Acerinox, Gamesa, Ferrovial, Acciona, Ohl.

Our client invests in caixa and bankia, whose dependency we have already verified. 

Our client currently wishes to invest in other of those indicated here. To do this, we will check whether caixa and bankia are part of the same component or not. And which other actions fit with them, to invest in this or these components formed by the actions we are looking for.

The data of the actions are collected, their averages during the last two years.

## We will calculate the Principal Component Analysis.

We have performed a Principal Component Analysis. It has been proven that Bankia and Caxia actually fit into the same component when making the circle of correlations. 3 components were taken, which are the ones with the greatest weight. And according to the results of the eigenvectors, investment in gamesa can be recommended as it has a positive weight of 0.4166.
